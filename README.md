# Fraction class (Java implementation)

A simple implementation of fractions, used to learn OOP in Java.

The Fraction class supports:
* addition, subtraction, multiplication and division
* simplification (2/4 -> 1/2)
* mixed numbers (eg. 5/2 == 2 1/2)

The Fraction class currently does not support:
* comparisons
* unit testing

A similar project [was written in C++](https://github.com/Kwpolska/fraction.cpp).

Usage: compile and run with your favorite Java execution environment.
